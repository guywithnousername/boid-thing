# Boid Test

I was inspired by one of Sebastian Lague's videos to try to create a boid simulation of my own using SDL2.
There are two unincluded folders in this repository that are needed. To get them, download SDL2 and move `sdl2/X.X.X/include` and `sdl2/X.X.X/lib` to this main folder. 
Then, run `make`.
